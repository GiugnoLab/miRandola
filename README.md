### Description:
MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that play an important role in the regulation of various biological processes through their interaction with cellular messenger RNAs. microRNAs are also present in extracellular human body fluids such as serum, plasma, saliva, and urine. Most of circulating microRNAs are present in human plasma and serum cofractionate with the Argonaute2 (Ago2) protein. However, circulating microRNAs have been also found in membranebound vesicles such as exosomes. Since microRNAs circulate in the bloodstream in a highly stable, extracellular form, they may be used as blood-based biomarkers for cancer and other diseases. miRandola is a comprehensive manually curated classification of extracellular circulating miRNAs. miRandola is connected to miRo` , the miRNA knowledge base, allowing users to infer the potential biological functions of circulating miRNAs and their connections with phenotypes.
